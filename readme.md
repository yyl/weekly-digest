An automated system that generates weekly reading digests from your Readwise account and commits them as draft blog posts to a GitHub repository. Perfect for bloggers who want to track their reading habits and share insights.

## Features

- üìä **Comprehensive Reading Statistics**: Track articles archived, total word count, and breakdowns by category/source
- üìù **Highlight Collection**: Gather all highlights created in the past week
- üìÑ **Markdown Generation**: Create beautifully formatted digest posts with YAML front matter
- üîÑ **Automated Deployment**: Runs weekly on Google Cloud Functions with Cloud Scheduler
- üì¶ **GitHub Integration**: Automatically commits draft posts to your blog repository

## What Gets Generated

Each weekly digest includes:

- **Overview Statistics**: Number of articles read, total words, highlight count, and average time to archive
- **Article Breakdowns**: By category (articles, books, etc.), source (RSS, imports, etc.)
- **Archived Articles List**: Titles, authors, word counts, and time to archive (in hours), sorted by most recently archived
- **Highlights**: All highlights created during the week with optional notes
- **YAML Front Matter**: Ready for static site generators (Hugo, Jekyll, etc.)

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Tokens

**Readwise Token:**
- Go to [https://readwise.io/access_token](https://readwise.io/access_token)
- Copy your access token

**GitHub Token:**
- Go to [GitHub Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Create a new token with `repo` scope
- Copy the token

### 2. Local Testing

```bash
# Clone or download the files
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install python-dotenv for local testing
pip install python-dotenv

# Copy environment template
cp .env.template .env

# Edit .env with your actual tokens
nano .env

# Run local test (dry run - won't commit to GitHub)
python test_local.py

# Run test with actual GitHub commit
python test_local.py --commit
```

### 3. Deploy to Google Cloud

```bash
# Make deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Set your environment variables
export READWISE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
export GITHUB_REPO_OWNER="your_username"
export GITHUB_REPO_NAME="your_repo_name"

# Deploy (replace with your actual project ID)
./deploy.sh your-google-cloud-project-id us-central1
```

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing required environment variables"**
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Check that your `.env` file is properly formatted

**"Readwise connection failed"**
- Verify your Readwise access token is correct
- Check if your token has proper permissions

**"GitHub connection failed"**
- Verify your GitHub token has `repo` scope
- Ensure the repository exists and you have write access

**"No data found"**
- The system looks for articles archived in the past 7 days
- If you haven't archived any articles recently, the digest will be minimal

### Viewing Logs

**Local Testing:**
```bash
python test_local.py
```

**Google Cloud Function:**
```bash
gcloud functions logs read weekly-digest-generator --region=us-central1 --project=your-project-id
```

**Google Cloud Console:**
Visit the Cloud Functions page in Google Cloud Console to view logs and monitoring.

### Manual Execution

You can manually trigger the Cloud Function:

```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs run weekly-digest-schedule --location=us-central1 --project=your-project-id
```

## Customization

### Modify the Schedule
Edit the `SCHEDULE` variable in `deploy.sh` before deployment.

### Change Output Format
Modify `markdown_generator.py` to customize the generated markdown format.

### Add More Data
Extend `data_processor.py` to include additional statistics or data from Readwise.

### Custom Repository Structure
Update the file path in `main.py` if your blog uses a different directory structure.

## Cost Considerations

This system is designed to be cost-effective:

- **Cloud Function**: Only runs once per week, typically under 1 minute
- **Cloud Scheduler**: Minimal cost for weekly scheduling
- **Pub/Sub**: Very low message volume
- **Estimated monthly cost**: Under $1 USD for typical usage

## Privacy and Security

- API tokens are stored as environment variables in Google Cloud
- No data is stored persistently; everything is processed in memory
- All communication uses HTTPS
- Generated content is committed to your private repository (or public if you choose)

## Contributing

Feel free to customize this system for your needs! Some ideas for enhancements:

- Add email notifications for failed runs
- Include book highlights in addition to article highlights
- Generate charts or visualizations of reading data
- Support for multiple Readwise accounts
- Integration with other note-taking systems

## License

This project is open source. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute as needed.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the logs for error messages
3. Test locally using `test_local.py`
4. Verify your API tokens are correct and have proper permissions
